# unsed_rpi
Bash script to remove unused packages from Raspberry Pi OS (aka raspbian). My goal is to remove packages that are not needed when running headless (no monitor or keyboard).

Download the script 
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dumbo25/unsed_rpi/main/unused_rpi.sh"

sudo chmod +x unused_rpi.sh

sudo bash unused_rpi.sh
